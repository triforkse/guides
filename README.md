# Developer Guides

This repository contains guides for how we program using different languages,
frameworks and tools.

These guides are living documents and should be updated frequently and freely.
You should see them as an extension of our [Trifork Handbook](http://trifork.se/handbook),
that contains all the technical details that are not part of the handbook.

The guides contain e.g. recommendations, guidelines, project templates,
code formatters, and scripts.

Apart from the is a list of general guidelines below we also.
